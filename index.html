About

Hi! I enjoy programming and having it come to life. I am working on building a mini-mobile robot and an IoT device while honing in my understanding of JavaScript plus electronics and circuits. Am intrigued with Web 3.0; it would be fun to marry user-interface know-how with front-end dev skills to one day join the Web 3.0 space as a UI Developer (goals).

Experiences that have shaped me:

    English Teacher in the Czech Republic
    Social Impact Contributor in Mexico City and New York City
    Humble Programmer
        Began with C, gained some Python knowledge, and now in my JavaScript journey
        I love the command line
        Git is fun, too, though I've heard horror stories -> traversing with caution
