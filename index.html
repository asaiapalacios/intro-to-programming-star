    <!-- <p>Web Developer in-the-making practicing web accessibility, user design and interactive experiences.</p> -->

    <p>Hola, I'm a curious go-to learner of programming. Who knew that my stint as an English teacher in the Czech Republic or my social impact contributions in Mexico City would lead to this fun and enjoyable path. Maybe I saw it coming. Sure, my love for sketching and animation, awe for interactive websites designed for us humans plus my prototyping abilities (think building Raspberry-Pi robots powered by artificial intelligence) had me swooning from the get-go and provided clues. So, naturally, I salute you, code editor and command line; for you see, I acknowledge you and recognize this much: Let the life-long web development journey begin (preferably in the Web 3.0 space because, you know, web3 is pretty awesome)! You in for the ride? I sure am.</p>

    <h1>Highlights</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Began with C, gained some Python and Ruby knowledge; now in my JavaScript journey</li>
        <li>I enjoy navigating the command line</li>
        <li>Git is fun, too, though I proceed with caution (because, well, I've heard horror stories)</li>
    </ul>
