    <h1>Asaia Palacios</h1>

    <p>Hola, I'm a curious go-to learner of programming. Who knew that my stint as an English and Spanish teacher in the Czech Republic some eons ago would somewhow morph into this enlightening path. Did I see it coming? Sure, my love for sketching and animation, awe for interactive websites designed for us humans in mind plus my prototyping abilities (think building Raspberry-Pi robots powered by artificial intelligence) had me swooning from the get-go and provided clues. So, naturally, I salute you, oh code editor and command line; for you see, I now recognize this much: Let the lifelong web development journey begin (eventually in the Web3 space on the frontend side for added oomph to user experiences in the blockchain). Yes, Web3 and blockchain are just around the corner! You in for the ride? I sure am.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Began with C, gained some Python and Ruby knowledge; now in my JavaScript journey</li>
        <li>I enjoy navigating the command line</li>
        <li>Git is fun, too, though I proceed with caution (because, well, I've heard horror stories)</li>
